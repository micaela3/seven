How to Play:
The deck of cards consists of 81 unique cards. Each card has 4 attributes - color, symbol, number, and shading.
Each attribute has 3 possible options.

	Color: red, green, or purple
	Symbol: oval, squiggle, or diamond
	Number: 1, 2, or 3
	Shading: solid, open, or striped

At the start of the game, 12 cards are dealt.

Players A and B try to find a set as fast as possible. The first player to find 4 sets is the winner. There is no need to take turns. One correctly identified set = 1 point.


A set consists of 3 cards satisfying the following characterstic: any single attribute is either the same on all 3 cards or different on all 3 cards.
An example of a valid set is the following:

Card	Color		Number		Symbol		Shading
0	    purple		3		    oval		  open
1	    red		    2		    oval		  striped
2	    green		  1		    oval		  solid

Here the color, number, and shading attributes are different on all 3 cards while the symbol attribute is the same on all 3 cards.

Be sure to select your Player letter ("A" or "B") before entering the card numbers that you think are sets.
If players don't see any sets, they can click the "Draw more Cards" button, but only 21 cards can be out.
